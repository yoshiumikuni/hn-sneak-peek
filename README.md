# hn-sneak-peek
A small program that can preview a nuke code title, author/artist, tags, cover or you can DOWNLOAD it and save to your computer. Some of ISP's block connection to nhentai web, so you must be connected to VPN in order to use it.

# How-to-Use
Simple, provide a nuke code you got form 9Gag, Reddit, or Twitter (or some of your firends that give it to you). Then, put it on textbox after that Click 'Go' and wait.

- 'View Cover' to see the manga cover.
- 'Download' to download the manga (you can see download progress in console).
