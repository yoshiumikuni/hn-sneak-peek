# hn-sneak-peek
A small program that can preview a nuke code title, author/artist, tags, and cover. So everytime you found a nuke code, you'll able to preview it before you got emotional damage. Some of ISP's block connection to nhentai web site, so you must be connected to VPN in order to use it.

# How-to-Use
Simple, provide a nuke code you got form 9Gag, Reddit, or Twitter (or some of your firends that give it to you). Then, put it on textbox after that Click 'Go' and wait.

# Library
Library that I'm using for this project is from https://github.com/hentai-chan/hentai. Go check that out!
